- **MetaMask Integration**: Deep integration with MetaMask for seamless testing of common dApp interactions.
- **TypeScript Support**: Enhanced TypeScript support for improved type safety and developer experience.
- **Anvil Support**: Easily spin up a local Anvil node with just one line of code for fast and isolated testing.
- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Synpress is optimized for speed, rivalling native Web2 testing framework performance.
